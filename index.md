# Welcome to the CrazyChoir Page!


## What is CrazyChoir?
**CrazyChoir** is a ROS 2 package developed by [Lorenzo Pichierri](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/lorenzo.pichierri/en), [Andrea Testa](https://andrea-testa.github.io) and [Giuseppe Notarsefano](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en). CrazyChoir is a ROS 2 toolbox allowing users to run simulations and experiments on swarms of Crazyflie nano-quadrotors. CrazyChoiR implements several tools to model swarms of Crazyflie nano-quadrotors and to run distributed, complex tasks both in simulation and experiments. Examples include task assignment, formation control and trajectory tracking settings.
