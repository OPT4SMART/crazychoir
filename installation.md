## Requirements and Installation

**CrazyChoir** requires ROS 2 Foxy to be installed on your system.

To install the toolbox, create a ROS 2 workspace and, inside the `src` directory, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/OPT4SMART/crazychoir.git .
```

Then, from the parent directory execute:
```
colcon build --symlink-install
```
